# Pneumonia-Detection-using-CNN
# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

##  Project Overview
This project utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify **chest X-ray images** as either **Pneumonia** or **Normal**. The goal is to develop an **automated and accurate diagnostic system** that assists medical professionals in detecting pneumonia more efficiently.

##  Dataset Information
- The dataset consists of **5,863 chest X-ray images** categorized into two classes:
  - **Pneumonia**
  - **Normal**
- The dataset is divided into **training, validation, and test sets**.
- Images are in **JPEG format** and have been medically screened for accuracy.

##  Model Architecture
This deep learning model is developed using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** with the following structure:
- **Convolutional Layers** ‚Äì Feature extraction with ReLU activation.
- **Max Pooling Layers** ‚Äì Reducing dimensionality while preserving key features.
- **Fully Connected Dense Layers** ‚Äì Learning high-level patterns.
- **Dropout Layers** ‚Äì Preventing overfitting.
- **Softmax Activation** ‚Äì Binary classification of pneumonia vs. normal cases.

##  Training Pipeline
### **1Ô∏è Data Preprocessing**
 Image resizing and normalization.
 Data augmentation to enhance model generalization.

### **2Ô∏è Model Training**
 **Loss Function:** Categorical Cross-Entropy.
 **Optimizer:** Adam (Learning Rate = 0.001).
 **Early Stopping:** Prevents overfitting and improves model efficiency.

### ** Model Evaluation**
- Model tested on **unseen test data**.
- Evaluation metrics include:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision & Recall**
  - **F1-score**
  - **Confusion Matrix for Misclassification Analysis**

##  Results & Performance Metrics
- **Training Accuracy:** 95.64%
- **Validation Accuracy:** 87.50%
- **Loss and Accuracy Trends:** Visualized using graphs.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Identifies classification errors and improvements.
